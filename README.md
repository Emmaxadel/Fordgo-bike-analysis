## Introduction
Fordgobike Trip dataset contains information about the trips made using their bikes. The dataset is generated in February, 2019 containing 183412 entries with 16 features. The dataset entails the time taken for each trip, the time the trip started and ended, the loation of the start and end stations, bike id, and brief information about the user (user type, brth year, gender).

## Analysis summary
This analysis assessed, cleaned, explored, summarized and explauned the dataset.
The analysis was done in python and visualized in PowerBi.
The analysis in python was divided into two main sessions - the exploratory analysis and the explanatory analysis. 
* In the exploratory analysis, the dataset was wrangled, and relationship between different variables were unveiled.
* In the explanatory analysis, key insights from the exploration were picked and plotted nicely which was later converted to slides for presentation.

## Visualisation in PowerBi
It was really nice vizualisig the dataset in PowerBi ðŸ¤©. 
<p>Much more insights were gathered.</p>
<p>The cleaned dataset from the python analysis was used for this visualization.</p>

<p>Different steps were taken before building the dashboard.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/clean-data-power-bi">Transforming and loading the dataset in power query</a></li>
<li><a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tutorial-create-measures">Creating measures</a></li>
<li><a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes">Customizing theme</a> - This will aparently save you a lot of time while creating your dashboard.</li>
<li>Voila, start building the dashboard! ðŸ¤©</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the dashboard contains 5 pages</p>
